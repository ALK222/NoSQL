Nicely done interiors - the antique door and the idol at the entrance, very beautiful and welcoming.\nComing the food this tile we we're welcomed with some ghee Mysore pak (yummy). The staff is really helpful in giving suggestions so we ordered a chicken, fish and mutton biryani /pulao. Delicious , full of masalas and tasty. Nothing to complain about the food. Bamboo chicken was the star dish , it just melts in your mouth.\nSo it's a place for some really fine dining. On Fridays and weekends do make a reservation, the have some crazy waiting .\nDefinitely recommended.",

The Cafe in \"Driven Cafe\" is rather disappointing, staff isn't very friendly, nor very observant to details. They ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains. I had Mocha and Coffee Crunch, both of which were average at its best and weren't something that I would remember.",

Everything about this place is super cool - be it the timing, concept, ambiance or the quality of coffees and snacks served. I visited this place on a bright Sunday morning and just fell in love with the place as I got a seat right next to muscular triumph. They have great collection of cars and bikes, which even one can hire on rent. I ordered hazelnut coffee, paneer kulcha and my friend ordered some dry fruits crispy sweet croissant along with coffee. Paneer kulcha was too good and coffee was just fine. Would visit this place again soon.",

That moment i decided to celebrate my son's first birthday in lime. Enquired with mr. Dinesh. Met him and decided the menu. He agreed for the changes i made. We ordered the cake too from them as i wanted a normal cake.\nThe birthday party was a huge hit with guests raving about the food. The starters were yummiest amongst all. Baby corn chilli garlic is the best. Bajjis were very hot and good. The highlight of the day was SIGNATURE drink from the lime. It was lemonade kind. Guests were\nenjoying it alot.\nWe wanted no onion no garlic items in t\nthe menu. Dal was very tasty without onions and garlic. Elders were surprised to see that in a restaurant they could get it.\nOne of my relatives commented that he ate such great spread after 10 years in a restaurant.\nWhat else does a host need?\nI strongly recommend lime for those who want great vegetarian food at best price. Mr sohail was available during the party and made sure every item was available till the end.\nThanks so much squeeze SQUEEZE AT THE LIME",

I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience. GROW UP !!!!!",

Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you. No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt. They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace.\n\nNext will try their haleem and some desserts too.",

I dont have an option for giving a NEGATIVE Rating, hence forced to give a \"1\", when its not even worth to have a rating. We were so hungry and planned to have some food, but we were so tired with the shake given and we packed up without even finishing half glass of the drink.

As u can see lot of adds about this..\n\nThe store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..\n\nStaff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to \ud83c\udf54 burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..\n\nBut over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes\n\nKeep going good guys.. See u again",

Even if you are with friends and don't want to miss out an important match this is a very nice place for good food, good company and the Indian team on a large screen :P. The staff is very very good (one of the best) .For the two of us they found a cosy corner where we would get some quietness yet not miss the match.When we were undecided about what to order, one of them politely suggested a Fish dish and that turned out to be oh so tasty! Cilantro fish is a must try here. I could have easily had another plate.The softness..the perfect marination..the taste of coriander...i loved it.Then i ordered the Non veg platter and I had wished i had just taken another suggestion :(. I didn't like prawn tempura at all.Pepper chicken,Soya chilli lamb and sesame fried fish were okayish.\nFor drinks again we turned to the waiter and he was again bang on with his choices.He got me a Belgian Kriek which is white beer based drink with the blend of cherry juice.I loved the tanginess followed by rich sweetness that lingers on in the mouth. My friend tried Erginder Dunkel - this is a wheat beer with delicate roasting aromas.I took a sip and liked it but i liked mine better.:P. Then came the best part of our dinner - the choco lava cake! The ice cream served in a seperate bowl and the brownie filled with chocolate syrup which oozes out when you cut it.Complete foodgasm! One of the best choco lavas i have had.I m gonna visit this place quite frequently :D",

On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!\n\nAmbiance\n===========\nAt the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at \"Panjim\" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.\n\nService\n===========\nAs we were seated indoors at the \"Panjim\" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.\n\nFood\n===========\nTa-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.\n\nValue for Money\n=============\nHmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.\n\nLets calculate,\n\nRating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n============= \nIf you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad.",

One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.\n\nOverall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.\n\nAmbiance--5/5\n\nTaste--4/5\n\nQuality and Quantity --4/5\n\nService--5/5\n\nPresentation--4/5",

The buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. Would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet.",

The beautiful music.. the feeling.. yes, the feeling we got, in this place ..!!\n\nSo we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.\nAddition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'\ud83d\ude23, but there was 'chanchal hawa' \ud83d\ude2c\n\nToo dramatic??- I know \ud83e\udd23\nAnyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.\nDon't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. \ud83d\ude1c Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.\n\nSo, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside \ud83d\ude2d. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.\n\nMESSAGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT: please have at least one staff in the restrooms, till you shut down, to avoid these kind of issues. Plzzzz.. \ud83d\ude25",

When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. \n\nOrdered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. \nNeways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.\n\nIts a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.\n\nTaste: 3\nService: 2\nAmbience: 2\nValue For Money: 2",

We had made it crystal clear that we were Zomato Gold holders and they said we could show the ID later. How is it fair that the staff asks us for the ID after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it!! We are first time users of Zomato Gold.\nWe had to walk out. Horrible service. Stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff. Thank you for ruining a special day!!! Why do such places have Zomato Gold partnership?

I usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (I prefer home-made), but the Keema Pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! We had even ordered for Baida Roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (By the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) Suleimaani Chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.\nThe ambience is also so good! They had these old ad posters put up on their walls - it really reminded me of those old Parsi restaurants in Mumbai.",

So sugars don't kill the flavors expected in that shake...!!!\n\nTried:\n\npoppy corn: Absolutely loved the flavor. You could get a clear flavor of popcorns. Would recommend to try if you love popcorns.\n\nold granola (honey loops) Again amazing. One of the must tries.\n\nberry cherry: Good amount of berries, great flavor. Recommended.\ncaramel Brownie: This was also pretty good. I am. personally not a caramel flavor lover, so not my fav.\n\ncoffee hazel nut: This was just WOW. must have for coffee lovers. They were really generous in putting the coffee in the shake :D. It had a strong coffee flavor. So if you are a true coffee lover you'll like it. ;)\nCheesecake (tuti fruity) : It had exactly tuti fruity flavor. Didn't like it much.\noreo and little hearts (cookie feast): Oreo shake never fails.. :) It was good.\nBlueberry slush: I didn't like the slush though. it only seemed to have color but no taste.\n\nMint o fruit: I don't like mint flavors at all. And was ofc Minty. So not my fav. If you like mint flavors it's for you.\n\nThey have different toppings for french fries and potato wedges and they are all just soooo amazing... Must Try.\n\nCheers.!!",
